## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

It's not much, but I've never used the grid display, I only use the flex display, so it was new to me.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my grid skills
